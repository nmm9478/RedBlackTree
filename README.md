Red Black Tree

This is my CSH major project!
This is the first time I am making representing a Red Black Tree in a project and this is my first time writing a README file!

I did this project because I really like to teach myself new things related to programming.
I know that algorithms and data structures are essential parts of learning computer science so I decided to challenge myself
with a Red Black Tree project. This was very difficult for me to figure out.
I had to read chapters of textbooks (Algorithms, for example), watch countless YouTube videos, read articles for hours,
and read as many Reddit posts regarding binary search trees as I could, until I understood the red black tree.
It was briefly taught to me in Computer Science class but I didn't understand it then. 
For days I would take walks and listen to podcasts about this special structure. 
My favorite podcast was made by two female developers on codenewbie.org who discussed the rules of the structure and 
the benefits of using it, such as for its efficiency. 
Basically, a red black tree has rules to achieve logarithmic runtime, so that nodes have its children and also a color (red or black). 
The colors themselves don't matter. The root node must always be black, the nodes must always be red or black,
red nodes can't appear consecutively (red node must always have a black node parent, and vice versa), each branch
(from beginning root node to the ending leaf node) must have the same number of black nodes.
